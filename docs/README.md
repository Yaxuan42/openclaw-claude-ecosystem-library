# OpenClaw + Claude Code Ecosystem Library

This repository is a curated catalog of open-source projects in the **OpenClaw + Claude Code** ecosystem. It tracks tools, plugins, skills, hooks, security utilities, memory systems, and orchestration frameworks that extend or integrate with OpenClaw and Claude Code.

## Purpose

Maintain a living reference of the ecosystem so that Yaxuan (and collaborators) can:

- Discover high-value tools quickly
- Assess maturity and risk before adopting a dependency
- Track how the ecosystem evolves week over week
- Identify gaps where new tooling is needed

## Update Strategy

The catalog is refreshed **weekly** by running the scan script:

```bash
./scripts/scan.sh
```

This script:

1. Runs 12 targeted `gh search repos` queries covering all key topic combinations
2. Saves raw results per query to `data/raw/`
3. Merges and deduplicates by `fullName`
4. Outputs the combined list to `data/repos.json`

After the scan, categories and scores in `data/repos.json` are reviewed and updated as needed, then the documentation files are regenerated.

## Selection Criteria

Projects are included based on relevance to these workflow areas:

| Area | What we look for |
|------|-----------------|
| **Orchestration** | Multi-agent coordination, dashboards, cron/scheduling, tmux management |
| **Security / Governance** | Firewalls, policy engines, scanners, hardening playbooks |
| **OpenClaw Skills / Integrations** | Reusable skill packages, platform connectors, awesome-lists |
| **Memory / Knowledge** | Persistent memory systems, knowledge retrieval, context management |
| **Notifications / Observability** | Desktop alerts, usage dashboards, monitoring hooks |
| **Hooks / Extensions** | Claude Code hook libraries, SDKs, proxy/mod systems |
| **Bridge / MCP** | MCP adapters, OpenClaw-to-Claude bridges, gateway connectors |

## Scoring

Each repo receives a **0-100 score** composed of four equally weighted dimensions:

| Dimension (max 25) | Signals |
|---------------------|---------|
| **Relevance** | Direct applicability to OpenClaw + Claude Code workflows |
| **Maturity** | Has license, language, meaningful description |
| **Activity** | Recent commits (2026-02 = high, 2025 = lower) |
| **Adoption** | Stars: 14k+ = 20, 100+ = 15, 10+ = 10, 1+ = 5 |
